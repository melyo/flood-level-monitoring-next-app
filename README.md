This project is a rapid prototype designed to manage water level sensors and visualize their data in real time. It includes a web-based user interface that displays the current water level and sends warning notifications to clients when critical thresholds are reached.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as the database and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS is used for styling, and [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) serves as the component library. The project also integrates [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) to subscribe to water level update events, enabling real-time data display and updates.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
